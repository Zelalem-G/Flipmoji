# 🎮 Flipemoji

**Flipemoji** is a simple and fun memory-matching game where you flip cards to find matching pairs of emojis. Built entirely from scratch using **React** and custom **CSS**, this project marks my very first complete app—from design to functionality!

## ✨ Features
- Flip cards and match similar emojis 🧠
- Sleek, responsive UI built with custom CSS 🎨
- Clean and beginner-friendly React code ⚛️
- Restart the game and challenge yourself again 🔁

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- React (no frameworks or UI libraries)
- Custom CSS for all styling

## 📚 About This Project
This is the first app I’ve built completely on my own. I wrote every line of CSS and React code myself to learn the full development process and bring a creative idea to life. 😊

## 🛠 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zelalem-G/flipemoji.git
